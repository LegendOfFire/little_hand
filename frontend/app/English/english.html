                        <h3>National Assessment Program – Literacy and Numeracy</h3>

                        <p>The <strong>National Assessment Program – Literacy and Numeracy (NAPLAN)</strong> is a series of tests focused on basic skills that are administered annually to Australian students. These standardised tests assess students' reading, writing, language (spelling, grammar and punctuation) and numeracy and are administered by the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority (ACARA). The National Assessment Program is overseen by the Council of Australian Governments Education Council. NAPLAN was introduced in 2008. ACARA has managed the tests from 2010 onwards. The tests are designed to determine if Australian students are achieving outcomes. There has been a great deal of contention in the educational community as to whether the tests are appropriate, whether teachers are teaching as they normally would or teaching to the test, and what the results of the test are being used for. The data obtained from the NAPLAN tests are collated and used to show all schools' average performance against other schools in the country on the Government My School website. The tests are also designed to be carried out on the same days all across Australia in any given year. Parents are able to decide whether their children take the test or not. The vast majority of Year 3, 5, 7 and 9 students participate.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Background</h4>

                        <p>Prior to the introduction of NAPLAN the testing of literacy and numeracy was done individually by each jurisdiction. According to New South Wales Public Schools the NAPLAN tests, which commenced in 2008, were instigated after the Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs (MCEETYA) determined that "national testing in literacy and numeracy would proceed for the full cohort of students in years 3, 5, 7 and 9 from 2008 onward". The NAPLAN tests would be used to determine if students were performing either above, at or below the National Minimum Standard in the areas of reading, language conventions, writing and numeracy skills for their particular year level. The emergence of a national schooling system in Australia is part of a shift towards making educational policy part of national economic policy in response to globalization. According to ACARA the main purpose of the NAPLAN tests is to measure whether literacy and numeracy skills and knowledge that provide the critical foundation for other learning and for their productive and rewarding participation in the community. In essence the Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs (MCEETYA) influence brought about a series of tests to determine whether students being prepared for later life appropriately in the present day school system. The introduction of national literacy and numeracy tests in 2008 has provided consistency, comparability and transferability of information on students’ literacy and numeracy performance nationally. The primary stakeholders are students, parents and teachers. According to a Parent's Brochure the NAPLAN test results will be used to assist students and parents in discussing student progress with teachers, identifying students who require "greater challenges or additional support", identifying teaching program strengths and weaknesses and allow for school program review and support".
                        </p>

                        <h4>Development</h4>
                        <p>The development of the NAP tests began in 1999 when the Australian ministers of education worked together to produce the Adelaide declaration on national goals for schooling in the 21st century which sought to make all young Australian successful learners, confident and creative individuals and active and informed citizens. ACARA claims in their MySchool fact sheet that "processes have been put in place to ensure that NAPLAN is a valid and reliable measurement of students' literacy and numeracy ability". It further goes on to state that "NAPLAN has a number of purposes including reporting national and jurisdictional achievements in literacy and numeracy as well as providing accurate and reliable measures of student and school performance. These purposes are carefully considered during the NAPLAN development process". The development of the test includes input from indigenous experts from around the country to ensure the tests are designed to be inclusive of all students. Intense community pressure on school performance has led to the growth of a test preparation industry. Each test contains between 30 and 40 questions. Most students complete the tests by using a pen and paper. In Victoria, Pearson Australia has been responsible for collecting NAPLAN data and marking some tests. In Queensland the printing and distribution of tests, data collection and some marking is undertaken by Fuji Xerox Document Management Solutions which also processes tests from South Australia. In 2016, some schools will be trialing online testing. If able to do so, some schools are expected to be able to conduct tests online by 2017. By 2019 all schools are expected to be able to complete testing online.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Analysis and evaluation</h4>
                        <p>The tests are not a high stakes event in a student's education. It is a snapshot of a student's current abilities. The tests do not measure higher-order thinking skills or creativity. NAPLAN is a tool used for school improvement. Data from NAPLAN is modelled according to the item response theory. This allows for comparisons to be made between tests, a process known as equating.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Validity and reliability</h4>
                        <p>The down side of NAPLAN can be see when teachers are teaching to the test rather than teaching to the curriculum as can be seen in Victoria where according to Perkins (2010) teachers have been told to "teach explicitly for the national tests that are the cornerstone of the Federal Government's controversial My School website". NAPLAN is also valid in that "special provisions which typically will reflect the support normally provided in the classroom may be provided to students with disabilities or special needs". The Validity and Reliability in Quality Assessment in relation to NAPLAN can be summed up by ACARA in that they use an equating process to "provide a high level of assurance as to the reliability of comparisons between years" and that this process ensures that "any test difference has been taken into account before making statements about one year's results compared to the next".
                        </p>

                        <h4>Flexibility and fairness</h4>
                        <p>On the point of fairness it is important not to just rate the fairness of the test itself but to also rate the procedure of giving the test as well. Apart from the fact that the test is given mid-year so not all learning may have been successfully completed as would be expected by the end of the year for that particular grade, writes that Queensland Teachers Union president Steve Ryan said some schools "probably have devoted too much time to NAPLAN". Although the test itself is extremely fair in that all students perform the same test nationwide, it also does not seem to take into account the fact that students in schools don’t just comprise the average but also include the likes of special needs students. ACARA points out that "Students can be exempted from one or more NAPLAN tests if they have significant intellectual or functional disability or if they are from a non-English-speaking background and arrived in Australia less than one year before the tests". It is understood therefore that NAPLAN is designed to test Literacy and Numeracy levels in students considered to be normal. There is also the consideration to be given to the fact that selective schools can pick and choose which students attend their schools giving them unfair advantage in attaining higher scores in almost any national assessment and especially in NAPLAN.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Authenticity</h4>
                        <p>As far as authenticity is concerned in the NAPLAN tests there are elements of real-world application and there are elements that are not real-world. One of the important points to consider however with the NAPLAN tests is that, especially in relation to numeracy, not all areas can have immediately foreseeable real-world application however that does not necessarily mean that the questions are unimportant. For the most part, the NAPLAN tests do seem to have quite a bit of real-world authenticity about them.</p>

                            The NAPLAN Data Service identify areas of strength or weakness within a school or classroom. At the classroom level, the Item Analysis Report, the Writing Criteria Report and (for numeracy in particular) the Assessment Area Report provide powerful diagnostic information which can be used to complement school assessment and to inform the planning of teaching and learning programs. Reports are usually delivered in September. Each student tested receives a student report. Schools receive detailed results as to how each student answered individual questions, but do not have access to what the questions were. The tests provide an indication, not a fine grading, of a student's performance. Parents are only given general feedback as to which percentile band their children are in for each type of test. ACARA does not provide the magnitude of the measurement error or the imprecision of the tests. On average in almost all NAPLAN tests home-schooled students perform better than students who attend schools. Some schools, particulatly small ones, are reporting such significant changes in year to year results that the results are meaningless. The data from NAPLAN is collated onto the MySchool website. The Australian Primary Principals Association does not support the publication of results in a way that allows for easy intra-school comparisons. The results are graded along a series of ten bands based on achieving complex solutions to questions and spanning all age groups. Data analysis packages are available to schools. Some school are using the results from NAPLAN on an individual basis when making decisions regarding enrolment. Tests results are directly linked to federal funding agreements with the states. The delay between testing and the release of results has been criticised for taking too long to be useful within the same year. The test results have shown that since 2008 Year 3 students have gained at reading, grammar and writing skills. They have also revealed that improvements in spelling and numeracy were achieved by Year 5 students while the writing skills of Year 7 and 9 students have declined.

                        <h3>Study options</h3>

                        <p>In Australia, education begins in primary school, then continues to secondary school and through to tertiary. Tertiary education ranges from undergraduate coursework through to research-based postgraduate study. Options vary depending on the course and the educational institution. English language classes are available at all levels of education in Victoria. Check with your school, college or university to find out what they offer.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Schools</h4>

                        <p>Victorian school education starts with primary. Children attend school from age five to 12. After primary school, children attend secondary school from 12 to 18 years. Students attend school from around 8.30am to 3.30pm, Monday to Friday.
                        </p>


                        <h4>School terms</h4>
                        <p>Each school year there are four terms. Terms are sometimes called semesters. The school year starts in late January or February and ends in December. There is a short holiday between terms and a longer summer holiday in December and January.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Girls and boys learn together</h4>

                        <h3>Victorian Certificate of Education</h3>
                        <p>The <strong>Victorian Certificate of Education</strong> or <strong>VCE</strong> is the credential awarded to secondary school students who successfully complete high school level studies (year 11 and 12 or equivalent) in the Australian state of Victoria. Study for the VCE is usually completed over two years, but can be spread over a longer period of time in some cases. It is possible to pass and obtain the VCE without completing the end of year exams. The VCE was established as a pilot project in 1987. The earlier Higher School Certificate (HSC) was abolished in 1992.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Structure</h4>
                        <p>The Victorian Certificate of Education is generally taught in years 11 and 12 of secondary education in Victoria, however some students are able to commence their VCE studies in year 10 or earlier if the school or institution allows it. All VCE studies are organised into units. VCE subjects typically consist of four units with each unit covering one semester of study. Each unit comprises a set number of outcomes (usually two or three); an outcome describes the knowledge and skills that a student should demonstrate by the time the student has completed the unit. Subject choice depends on each individual school. Units 3/4 of a subject must be studied in sequential order, whereas units 1/2 can be mixed and matched. Students are not required to complete all the units of a subject as part of the VCE course, meaning they are able to change subject choice between years 11 and 12. On completing a unit, a student receives either a 'satisfactory' (S) or 'non-satisfactory' (N) result. If a student does not intend to proceed to tertiary education, a 'satisfactory' result is all that is required to graduate with the VCE. If a student does wish to study at a tertiary level then they will require an ATAR. In order to gain an ATAR a student must satisfactorily complete three units of any subject in the English field (at least one English field subject is compulsory) and twelve units in any other subjects.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Assessment</h4>
                        <p>VCE studies are assessed both internally (in school) and externally (through the Victorian Curriculum and Assessment Authority (VCAA). During units 1/2 all assessment is internal, while in units 3/4 assessment is conducted both internally and externally.</p>
                        <h4>Internal assessment</h4>
                        <p>Internal assessment is conducted via "school assessed coursework" (SACs) and "school assessed tasks" (SATs). "School assessed coursework" (SACs) are the primary avenue of internal assessment, with assessment in every VCE study consisting of at least one SAC. SACs are tasks that are written by the school and must be done primarily in class time; they can include essays, reports, tests, and case studies. Some studies in the visual arts and technology areas are also assessed via "school assessed tasks" (SATs). SATs are generally practical tasks that are examined in school. Both SACs and SATs are scaled by VCAA against external assessment; this is to eliminate any cheating or variances in task difficulty.
                        </p>
                        <h4>External assessment</h4>
                        <p>External assessment is conducted in the form of examinations set by the Victorian Curriculum and Assessment Authority for units 3/4 studies. As of 2013, only the General Achievement Test (GAT) will be examined in June, with all subjects now only having one external assessment with the exceptions of mathematics subjects, and LOTE studies, which consist of both a written and oral external test. All examinations excepting the GAT are held in late October and most of November. Subjects in the LOTE field (languages other than English) are also assessed in the form of oral examinations. Subjects in the Music field are assessed by a performance for a VCAA panel of examiners as part of their external assessment. All performance based external assessment (Oral Examinations and Music Performances) are typically held in early October.
                        </p>
                        <h4>General Achievement Test (GAT)</h4>
                        <p>Main article: General Achievement Test The GAT is an essential part of VCE external assessment. It provides the basis of a quality assurance check on the marking of examinations. Any student who is enrolled in a VCE units 3/4 study is required to sit the GAT.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Scoring</h4>
                        <h4>Study scores</h4>
                        <p>A student who satisfactorily completes units 3/4 of a VCE study is eligible for a study score of between 0 and 50. Study scores are calculated by VCAA, and indicate a student's performance in relation to all other students who undertook that study. Study scores are calculated according to a normal distribution, where the mean is 30 and the standard deviation is 7, with most study scores falling in the range 23 to 37. For studies with many enrolments (1000 or more), a study score of 40 or more places a student in the top 9% of all students in that subject.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Scaling</h4>
                        <p>Scaling is the process that adjusts VCE study scores into ATAR subject scores. The Victorian Tertiary Admissions Centre (VTAC) adjusts all VCE study scores to equalise results between studies with stronger cohorts, and those with weaker ones. Contrary to common perception, scaling is not based on the difficulty of the subject, as each study score is in fact a ranking. The score adjustment ensures that in those subjects where it is easier to overtake the cohort, the score is adjusted downwards, while in those subjects where it is difficult to rank highly, it is moved upwards.</p>

                        <h4>ATAR</h4>
                        <p>Main article: Australian Tertiary Admission Rank In total there are 129 VCE studies ranging across education fields including humanities, science, mathematics, technology, the arts and language as well as incorporating vocational studies. • A student must study an English subject; with a choice between English, English (EAL), English Language or Literature. • Mathematics. At units 1 and 2, a student may study Foundation Mathematics, General Mathematics, Specialist Mathematics, or Mathematical Methods. At units 3 and 4, a student may study Further Mathematics (practical application - data analysis and discrete mathematics), Mathematical Methods (mainstream calculus based course) or Specialist Mathematics (advanced calculus based course). There are also University Extension studies available for high-achieving students. These subjects are carried out through multiple universities, including Monash University, The University of Melbourne, Swinburne University and Deakin University
